    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe graphical analysis of U.S. unemployment rates during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic highlights significant trends and disparities in economic resilience across states.\n\nFrom the animated map visualization, we observe that states with diverse, service-based economies (such as California and New York) experienced sharp rises in unemployment during both crises. However, these states tended to recover faster due to a shift toward remote work and flexible job structures, especially during COVID-19.\nStates heavily reliant on specific sectors like tourism and manufacturing (e.g., Nevada and Michigan) faced prolonged high unemployment rates. This suggests that sector-specific economic dependencies can heighten vulnerability during global economic disruptions.\nThe line plot of unemployment trends over time reveals that while the 2008 financial crisis caused a relatively uniform spike in unemployment across states, the COVID-19 pandemic led to more varied impacts, with certain states being hit much harder than others. This difference may be attributed to varying public health restrictions, digital adaptability, and government support measures across states.\nThe bar chart race visualization, showing the top 10 states with the highest unemployment rates over time, highlights that certain states consistently appeared in the high-unemployment category across crises. This indicates persistent structural challenges that may require targeted policy interventions."
